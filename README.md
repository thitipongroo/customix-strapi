# üöÄ Getting started with Strapi

#### Step 1: Run the installation script

Run the following command in a terminal:

```
npx create-strapi-app@latest my-project --quickstart
# or
yarn create strapi-app my-project --quickstart
```

#### Step 2: Register the first administrator user

Once the installation is complete, your browser automatically opens a new tab.

By completing the form, you create your own account. Once done, you become the first administator user of this Strapi application. Welcome aboard, commander!

You now have access to the [admin panel](http://localhost:1337/admin/auth/register-admin):
